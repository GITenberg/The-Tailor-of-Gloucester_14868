description: "The Tailor of Gloucester is a children's book written and illustrated\
  \ by Beatrix Potter, privately printed by the author in 1902, and published in a\
  \ trade edition by Frederick Warne & Co. in October 1903. The story is about a tailor\
  \ whose work on a waistcoat is finished by the grateful mice he rescues from his\
  \ cat and was based on a real world incident involving a tailor and his assistants.\
  \ For years, Potter declared that of all her books it was her personal favourite.\n\
